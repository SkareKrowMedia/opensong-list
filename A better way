  <lyrics>[C]
 THERE SURELY IS A WAY THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR NIGHT TO DAY,
 AND CAN ROLL THE CLOUDS OF SIN SO FAR FROM VIEW.
 GOD HAS CHANGED US FROM THE OLD WHERE NONE CAN TEMPT US BACK WITH GOLD,
 AND HAS SHOWN TO US THERE IS A BETTER WAY.
[V1]
 THERE’S A WAY THAT SEEMETH RIGHT TO A MAN IN HIS OWN SIGHT,
 BUT GOD’S PLAN WAS NEVER IN THE MIND OF MAN.
 IF WE LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY IN OUR HEARTS CONTROL FULL SWAY
 HE WILL SHOW TO US THERE IS A BETTER WAY.
[V2]
 THERE’S A PEOPLE WATCHING CLOSE JUST TO SEE US MAKE THE MOST,
 OF THE GIFT THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US TO USE.
 CAN’T WE SHOW TO THEM SOME WAY THAT CHRIST LIVES IN US TODAY
 WE WILL THEN BE FINDING OUT A BETTER WAY.
[V3]
 GOD HAS SHOWN US THAT ALL SIN CAN IN NO WISE ENTER IN,
 TO A PEOPLE HE HAS CALLED TO BE HIS BRIDE.
 IF WE LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR TOO IN THE WAY HE TOLD US TO
 WE WILL THEN BE LIVING IN A BETTER WAY.</lyrics></song>
