  <lyrics>[V1]
 Each day I’ll do Golden deed,
 By helping those Who are in need;
 My life on earth Is but a span, And so I’ll do The best I can,
[V2]
 To be  a child Of God each day,
 My light must shine Along the way;
 I’ll sing His praise While ages roll,
 And strive to help Some troubled soul,
[V3]
 The only life That will endure,
 Is one that’s kind And good and pure;
 And so for God I’ll take my stand,
 Each day I’ll lend A helping hand,
[V4]
 I’ll help someone In time of need,
 And journey on With rapid speed;I’ll help the sick,
 The poor and weak,And words of kindness To them speak,
[V5]
 While going down Life’s weary road,
 I’ll try to lift Some trav’ler’s load;
 I’ll try to turn The night to day,
 Make flowers bloom Along the way,
[C]
 Life’s evening sun Is sinking low,
 A few more days And I must go To meet the deeds That I have done,
 Where there will be No setting sun.</lyrics></song>
