  <lyrics>[V1]
 One day I lost my way, But no one cared.
 I searched for happiness, but found despair.
 Then Jesus spoke to me, revealed to me my sin,
 "I'll heal your broken heart if I may enter in".
[V2]
 Have you been wondering why you're alone?
 Does God seem far away, you doubt His love?
 Now Christ is at the door, He sees a heart that's torn.
 His Blood was shed for you to give you life anew.
[C]
 A broken heart I gave, a worthless thing.
 An empty life was all that I could bring.
 Then Jesus filled my life with love divine.
 He healed my broken heart, and now I know He's mine.
