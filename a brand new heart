  <lyrics>[V1]
 When I was lost in sin, I thought I was happy;
 I used to drink and gamble, Yes, I used to be that kind.
 But since I met the Lord, My life’s been different;
 Since God gave me A brand new heart And a brand new mind.
[V2]
 I no longer do The sinful things,
 That I used to do;
 Since God gave me A brand new heart,
 And a brand new mind.
[C]
 A brand new heart, A brand new mind,
 That’s what He gave me,
 And I’ll never forget the Night He saved me,
 Before that night, I never knew I was so blind,
 Till God gave me a Brand new heart And a brand new mind.</lyrics></song>
