  <lyrics>[V1]
 WHILE TRAVELING DOWN LIFE’S ROAD TOWARD HEAVEN’S BLEST ABODE.
 I WANT TO LIVE FOR GOD EACH PASSING DAY.
 WHEN LIFE ON EARTH IS O’ER WE’LL START FOR HEAVEN’S SHORE.
 THEN WE WILL ALL BE GATHERED HOME TO STAY;
 WHEN GABR’EL’S TRUMPET SOUNDS,
 THE DEAD WILL LEAVE THE GROUND,
 AND EVERY EARTHLY THING WILL PASS AWAY.
 YES, WE’LL FORGET EACH CARE, THE BURDENS WE DID BEAR.
 O WON’T THAT BE A HAPPY HALLELUJAH DAY?
[V2]
 WHILE HANGING ON THE TREE, HE DIED FOR YOU AND ME.
 SUCH PAIN HE SUFFERED FOR MY SINSICK SOUL.
 AND THEN HE WENT AWAY,
 SAID HE’D RETURN SOMEDAY TO TAKE HIS CHILDREN HOME WITH HIM TO STAY;
 YES, WHEN HE COMES AGAIN,
 WITH HIM WE THEN SHALL REIGN UP IN THAT LOVELY CITY BUILT FOURSQUARE.
 YES, WE WILL ALL REJOICE WITH HAPPY HEART AND VOICE,
 O WON’T THAT BE A HAPPY HALLELUJAH DAY?
[V3]
 THERE WILL BE A HAPPY DAY,
 A GREAT HOME COMING DAY,
 WHEN ALL GOD’S CHILDREN LAND SAFE HOME AT LAST.
 REUNION TIME WILL BE, WHEN LOVED ONES WE SHALL SEE.
 WITH EVERY CARE AND SORROW PAST,WE’LL WEAR A ROBE AND CROWN.
 WITH LOVED ONES MARCH AROUND.
 AS WE THE BEAUTIES OF THAT LAND SURVEY,
 NO SIN TO AGITATE, WE THEN WILL CELEBRATE,
 WON’T WE BE HAPPY ON THAT HALLELUJAH DAY?</lyrics></song>
