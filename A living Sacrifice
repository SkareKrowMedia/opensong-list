  <lyrics>[V1]
 HOW CAN WE EVER KNOW, THE RICHES OF OUR LORD.
 ONCE BOUND IN UNBELIEF, HIS MERCY REACHED US ALL.
 THOUGH HOPELESS, LOST AND BLIND, HIS SPIRIT TOUCHED OUR MINDS.
 AND GAVE US A HOPE  FOR LIFE AND IMMORTALITY. 
[V2]
 TO HIM I CONSECRATE THIS VESSEL MADE OF CLAY.
 TO MOLD IT AT HIS WILL, TO USE IN HIS OWN WAY.
 I HAVE RECEIVED FROM HIM, THIS LIFE THAT DWELLS WITHIN.
 AND I’M NOT MY OWN, I WANT MY HEART, TO BE HIS THRONE. 
[V3]
 I HUMBLY OFFER HIM, THIS SACRIFICE I BRING,
 WHATEVER I POSSESS, THAT HE CAN USE TO BLESS.
 MY ALL TO HIM I GIVE, IN HIM TO MOVE AND LIVE,
 A MANIFESTATION OF, HIS PERFECT WILL IN ME.
[C]
 A LIVING SACRIFICE, THAT’S WHAT I LONG TO BE.
 THE KIND OF SACRIFICE, THAT HE BECAME FOR ME.
 AND BY A MIND RENEWED, TRANSFORMED IN HIM TO PROVE.
 HIS GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE AND PERFECT WILL IN ME.</lyrics></song>
