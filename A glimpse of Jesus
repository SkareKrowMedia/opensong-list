  <lyrics>[V1]
 IT TAKES THE CRUSHING OF THE ROSE TO MAKE THE FRAGRANCE RARE;
 IT TAKES THE FIERY FURNACE AND AFFLICTIONS HARD TO BEAR;
 IT TAKES THE SEARCHING OF OUR HEARTS, THE MOLDING OF THE CLAY,
 TO MAKE US FIT TO BE HIS BRIDE WHEN HE COMES BACK SOME DAY.
[V2]
 I’VE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF JESUS AS HE’S PASSING THROUGH THE LAND;
 HE’S PASSING IN A PEOPLE, IN A SMALL BUT HOLY BAND.
 THEY HAVE NO EARTHLY DWELLING PLACE THEIR WEARY FEET TO REST;
 BUT, PRAISE THE LORD,  WE’RE MOVING ON TO BE KING JESUS’ GUEST.
[C]
 SOMETIMES THE LOAD SEEMS HEAVY,
 AND THE CROSS SEEMS HARD TO BEAR;
 SOMETIMES THE BILLOWS ROLL SO HIGH  I ASK,
 “LORD, DO YOU CARE?” BUT WHEN MY WAY IS
 DARKEST AND THE PATHWAY SEEMS SO DIM,
 I LOOK AND SEE HIS CHOSEN FEW AND CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM.</lyrics></song>
