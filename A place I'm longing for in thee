  <lyrics>[V1]
 WHEN I THINK OF WHERE I’VE BEEN,
 AND THE PIT YOU FOUND ME IN.
 I’VE COME A LONG, LONG WAY DEAR LORD,
 I KNOW IT’S TRUE. BUT ONE THING I SURELY KNOW.
 I HAVE A LONG WAY YET TO GO, BEFORE I REACH THAT PLACE
 I’M LONGING FOR IN YOU.
[V2]
 AT THE DAWNING OF EACH DAY, LET ME LOOK TO YOU AND PRAY.
 FOR YOUR PERFECT WILL IN EVERYTHING I DO.
 TELL ME WHEN AND WHERE TO GO,
 AND THE SEED  YOU’D HAVE ME SOW.
 THAT I MAY REACH THAT PLACE I’M LONGING FOR IN YOU.
[V3]
 THERE ARE MOUNTAINS YET TO CLIMB,
 BEFORE THIS PLACE IN YOU I’LL FIND.
 AND I’M SURE THAT MANY TRIALS, I’LL GO THROUGH.
 BUT EACH TEST I OVERCOME, WILL MAKE ME MORE 
 LIKE YOUR DEAR SON AND HELP ME REACH THAT PLACE
 I’M LONGING FOR IN YOU.
[C]
 OH THERE’S A PLACE, LORD 
 I’M LONGING FOR IN THEE.
 AND TO FIND THIS PLACE MEANS ALL 
 THE WORLD TO ME.‘TWILL BE WORTH ANYTHING
 YOU PUT ME THROUGH. JUST TO REACH THAT PLACE
 I’M LONGING FOR IN YOU.</lyrics></song>
