  <lyrics>[v1]
 OH LORD, OUR HEARTS ARE YEARNING
 FOR THE PROMISED LATTER RAIN,
 WHERE THE JEW AND GENTILE GATHER
 IN A CHURCH RESTORED AGAIN.
 THERE WILL BE NO MORE SEPARATION;
 GOD’S PEOPLE WILL BE ONE 
 THEIR PRAISE EXTEND TO HEAVEN.
 GOD’S WILL IN EARTH BE DONE.
[v2]
 HE WILL HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTED.
 HE WILL CAUSE THE BLIND TO SEE.
 HE WILL MAKE THE LAME TO WALK AGAIN.
 HE WILL SET THE CAPTIVE FREE.
 EV’RY PRISON SHALL BE OPENED.
 EV’RY SIN HE’LL TAKE AWAY.
 AND THE LORD WILL REIGN IN ZION;
 THAT WILL BE A GLORIOUS DAY!
[v3]
 EV’RY VALLEY SHALL BE EXALTED.
 EV’RY MOUNTAIN BE MADE LOW,
 AND THE CROOKED PATH BE STRAIGHT AGAIN.
 AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD SHALL FLOW.
 JUST TO SEE HIS POW’R AND GLORY,
 AND BE FILLED WITH LOVE DIVINE.
 AND TO HEAR HIS VOICE FROM HEAVEN,
 “I HAVE SPOKEN, THOU ART MINE.”
[C]
 AND THEN A RIVER 
 SHALL FLOW IN THE DESERT
 AND A LIGHT FROM HEAVEN DESCEND.
 ALL THE EARTH SHALL BE FILLED 
 WITH HIS GLORY, FOREVER, WORLD WITHOUT END.</lyrics></song>
