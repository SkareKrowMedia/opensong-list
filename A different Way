  <lyrics>[V1]
 Now, the wise men went a seeking
 For the Savior had been born
 And they knew that old king Herod
 Was out to take away our Lord;
 When they found the baby Jesus,
 Knelt beside him in the hay,
 Then they left a different way.
[V2]
 From, babe born in the manger
 To the Man of Galilee He healed the sick
 And saved the sinners, And set the captive free;
 So, no matter where you’re headed,
 Come to Jesus today And you’ll leave a diff’rent way.
[C]
 A different way, A different way,
 Come to Jesus And you’ll leave a different way,
 No matter what road You may be walking,
 Came to Jesus today, And you’ll leave a different way </lyrics></song>
