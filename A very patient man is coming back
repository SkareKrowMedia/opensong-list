  <lyrics>[v1]
 This world is watching In dismay,
 The things that are happening,
 All around the earth today.
 But this Body does not dread,
 For we’ve been taught What lies ahead,
 And we know our Lord
 Will soon be on His way.
[v2]
 In Babylon they’ve been taught for Years and years,
 That anytime was the time He could appear;
 But this Body’s always said,
 “He won’t come back for a Church that’s dead.”
 So we’re getting ready For the time,
 When we see Him here.
[v3]
 The Early Church went Through the dismal times,
 He said it would before The truth we’d surely find.
 Now with a five-fold ministry, That he’s preparing for the 
 World to see; The latter rain is alive And doing fine.
[V4]
 And now God’s plan is Falling into place,
 Oh, to be part of the brideship that awaits.
 For when He sounds The wedding bells,
 He’ll lead His Bride Behind the veil;
 This Body knows the Bride is what He’ll come to take.
[c]
 A very patient man Is coming back,
 He’s been waiting a Long, long time,
 For the church to Learn the facts;
 Now the time is drawing near, For the Bridegroom to appear,
 This Body knows that the Lord is coming back.</lyrics></song>
