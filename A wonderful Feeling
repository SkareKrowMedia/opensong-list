  <lyrics>[V1]
 FOR SUCH A LONG TIME I TRIED TO FIND
 JUST A LITTLE PEACE OF MIND,
 BUT NOTHING I TRIED KEPT ME SATISFIED,
 NO LASTING JOY DID I FIND;
 BUT WHEN I FOUND JESUS
 SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE ME SAID
 “YOUR SEARCHING IS FINALLY O’ER”;
 AND IT’S A WONDERFUL FEELING
 WHEN YOU KNOW YOU’VE FOUND
 WHAT YOU’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!
[V2]
 I DIDN’T KNOW FOR SURE
 JUST WHAT TO LOOK FOR,
 I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT DREAMS
 I SHOULD DREAM;
 CAUSE EV’RYTHING THAT GLITTERS
 AND LOOKS SO BRIGHT
 ISN’T ALWAYS AS IT SEEMS;
 JUST WHEN I THOUGHT HAPPINESS
 COULDN’T BE FOUND,
 THE SAVIOR KNOCKED AT MY DOOR,
 AND IT’S A WONDERFUL FEELING
 WHEN YOU KNOW YOU’VE FOUND
 WHAT YOU’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!
[C]
 OH, IT’S A WONDERFUL FEELING
 WHEN YOU KNOW YOU’VE FOUND
 WHAT YOU’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!
 NO MORE SEARCHING,
 NO MORE LOOKING AROUND
 TO FIND SOMETHING WORTH LIVING FOR;
 I FOUND JESUS AND THERE’S
 NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
 HE’S EV’RYTHING I WANTED AND MORE,
 AND IT’S A WONDERFUL FEELING
 WHEN YOU KNOW YOU’VE FOUND
 WHAT YOU’VE BEEN LOOKING FOR!</lyrics></song>
