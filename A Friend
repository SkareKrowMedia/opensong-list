  <lyrics>[V1]
 Do you ever feel alone And you don’t know what to do
 Just call on the Lord He’ll see you through.
 For He’s a friend And He’ll always be there.
 Just take Him at His word Give Him every care. For…
[V2]
 Do you know my friend? Have you given Him a chance
 Try Him just once And you will have to dance.
 For He will take every burden That you bear And carry you on with Him. For…
[C]
 He’s a Rock That you can run to.
 He’s the one who cares for you.
 He’s a friend that’s closer Than a brother.
 He’s a friend that stands Above all others. Oh Lord.</lyrics></song>
