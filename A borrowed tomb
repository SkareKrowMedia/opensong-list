 It was a borrowed tomb That they placed Him in that day.
 A borrowed tomb because He knew He would not stay.
 He only needed a place For  little while Then He would arise.
 The borrowed tomb now is empty, And Jesus is alive.
[V1]
 They placed my Savior In Joseph’s tomb
 And saw that the seal was sure.
 The Pharisees worried That someone would take Him
 And things would be worse than before.
 But at the dawning of a new day Mary found the stone rolled away.
 The angel said, “He’s not here anymore.”
[V2]
 This body I live in is borrowed, too.
 I can see signs of decay.
 But all will be well When I leave an empty shell
 When He call me away. Cause at the dawning of a new day
 My soul will be gone away. I’ll leave an empty tomb of clay.
[V3]
 It’s just a borrowed tomb
 That I was placed in one day.
 A borrowed tomb because of Him I will not stay.
 I only need a place for a little while
 Then my life on earth will end.
 This borrowed tomb will be empty And I will live with Him.</lyrics></song>
