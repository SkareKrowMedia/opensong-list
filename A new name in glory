  <lyrics>[V1]
 I was once a sinner, But I came Pardon to receive 
 From my Lord: This was freely given, 
 And I found that He always Keeps His word.
[V2]
 I was humbly kneeling At the cross,
 Fearing naught But God’s angry frown;
 When the heavens opened And I saw that my name 
 Was written down.
[V3]
 In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,”
 O the joy that came To my soul!
 Now I am forgiven, And I know by the blood 
 I am made whole.
[C]
 There’s a new name Written down in glory,
 And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
 And the white-robed angels Sing the story,
 “A sinner has come home.” For there’s a new name 
 Written down in glory, And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
 With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven, Nevermore to roam.</lyrics></song>
