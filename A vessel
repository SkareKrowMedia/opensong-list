  <lyrics>[V1]
 A vessel for you Lord,
 A vessel for you,
 That’s what I’m willing to be
 I want to be used O Lord by you,
 So make me a vessel for you.
[V2]
 To be a vessel
 You must do My will, 
 To be a vessel You must learn to be still,
 All I’m asking of you is you,
 So the vessel I need is you
[V3]
 To be a vessel for you Lord,
 A vessel for you,
 That’s what I’m willing to be
 I want to be used O Lord by you,
 So make me a vessel for you.
[C]
 To be a vessel You must learn to move,
 To be a vessel You must hear my word,
 If you put into practice What you know to do,
 You’ll be a vessel That I can use.</lyrics></song>
